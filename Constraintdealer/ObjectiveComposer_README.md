# ObjectiveComposer — Structured Sub-Objective Composition

## 1. The Problem: Manual Weight Tuning

Real-world objectives have competing sub-terms. Traditionally, you assign each a
weight and sum them:

```python
f = 15.0 * tracking_error + 2.0 * smoothness + 0.1 * control_effort
```

This works, but has well-known problems:

| Problem | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Unbounded** | A weight of 15 has no upper limit — one bad trajectory can blow up `f` |
| **Cross-term scale mismatch** | Tracking is ~100, smoothness is ~1 — weights must compensate |
| **Per-problem tuning** | New environment → new weights → trial and error |
| **No physical meaning** | What does `w=15.0` mean? Nothing interpretable |

## 2. The Solution: Per-Term Saturation Gain

Each sub-term independently goes through:

```
raw_value → log_transform → sigma_k(..., k=term_k) → bounded in [0, 1)
```

All compressed terms are summed, then passed through a final outer sigma:

```
f(x) = σ( Σ σ_k( T(term_i(x)), k=k_i ), k=k_outer )
```

### Why This Works

| Property | Manual Weights | Compose Objective |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Boundedness | Unbounded | Each term ∈ [0, 1) |
| Scale handling | Manual (divide by S) | Automatic (log_transform) |
| Gain control | Dimensionless weight w | k → knee in physical units |
| No dominance | One term can dominate | All terms bounded → no single term can hijack cost |

## 3. k as Physical Gain

**k controls the knee** — the raw value where the term half-saturates:

```
raw_knee ≈ exp(1/k) - 1
```

| k | Raw knee | Use case |
|---|----------|----------|
| 5.0 | ~0.22 m | Lateral tracking — sub-meter precision matters |
| 3.0 | ~0.40 m | Close-range obstacle buffer |
| 2.0 | ~0.65 m | Final approach accuracy |
| 1.0 | ~1.7 | Balanced, moderate sensitivity |
| 0.5 | ~6.4 | Path-integral tracking — wide range |
| 0.2 | ~147 | Longitudinal tracking — ~100m range |
| 0.1 | ~2.2×10⁴ | Control effort — only penalize extreme waste |

**Large k = high gain**: saturates early, sensitive to small changes.
**Small k = low gain**: wide linear range, only large values matter.

This is **more interpretable** than weights: a knee of 0.65m means
"I care about sub-meter final approach accuracy." A weight of 15.0
means... nothing physical.

## 4. Quick Start

### 4.1 Basic Usage

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import compose_objective

obj = compose_objective([
    (tracking_fn,   0.5, "tracking"),     # knee ~6.4 — wide range
    (final_fn,      2.0, "final"),        # knee ~0.65 — precise
    (control_fn,    1.0, "control"),      # knee ~1.7 — balanced
])
# obj is a standard (x, ctx) -> scalar callable, output in [0, 1)
```

### 4.2 Integration with Constran.build()

```python
from Constraintdealer.Constran import build, Deterministic
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import compose_objective

# Step 1: compose the objective
obj = compose_objective([
    (tracking_fn,   0.5, "tracking"),
    (final_fn,      2.0, "final"),
    (control_fn,    1.0, "control"),
])

# Step 2: build with constraints (just like any objective_fn)
cost_fn = build(obj, [
    Deterministic(obs_fn,  mode='hard', priority=1),
    Deterministic(ped_fn,  mode='hard', priority=2),
])

# Step 3: pass to solver
result = mmog_igo_optimizer_mpc(..., fitness_fn_total=cost_fn, ...)
```

### 4.3 Auto-k Mode

Don't want to choose k manually? Use `compose_objective_auto`:

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import compose_objective_auto

obj = compose_objective_auto([
    (tracking_fn,   5.0,  200.0),   # typical ~5, max ~200
    (final_fn,      0.5,  20.0),    # typical ~0.5, max ~20
    (control_fn,    1.0,  50.0),    # typical ~1, max ~50
])
# k is auto-computed via suggest_k(typical, max)
```

### 4.4 Diagnosing Per-Term Contributions

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import inspect_terms

info = inspect_terms(obj, x_test, ctx, [
    (tracking_fn,   0.5, "tracking"),
    (final_fn,      2.0, "final"),
    (control_fn,    1.0, "control"),
])
for c in info['contributions']:
    print(f"{c['name']}: raw={c['raw']:.3f} → compressed={c['compressed']:.3f} [{c['saturated']}]")
# Output:
#   tracking: raw=8.000 → compressed=0.740 [knee]
#   final:    raw=0.500 → compressed=0.528 [knee]
#   control:  raw=0.100 → compressed=0.058 [linear]
```

This tells you which terms are saturated (maxed out — their k may be too high),
which are in the knee region (good sensitivity), and which are still linear
(k may be too low, the term is barely contributing).

## 5. Before / After Comparison

### Before: Manual Weights

```python
def my_objective(z_flat, ctx):
    # Compute raw values
    track  = compute_tracking(z_flat, ctx)       # range ~0–500
    final  = compute_final_error(z_flat, ctx)    # range ~0–50
    smooth = compute_smoothness(z_flat, ctx)     # range ~0–10
    ctrl   = compute_control(z_flat, ctx)        # range ~0–5

    # Tune these weights for EVERY new problem:
    f = 1.0 * track + 15.0 * final + 1.5 * smooth + 0.1 * ctrl

    # Hope the solver can distinguish values across 3 orders of magnitude
    return f
```

### After: Compose Objective

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import compose_objective

obj = compose_objective([
    (compute_tracking,   0.2, "tracking"),    # knee ~147 — longitudinal
    (compute_final_error,2.0, "final"),       # knee ~0.65 — precise
    (compute_smoothness, 1.0, "smoothness"),  # knee ~1.7 — balanced
    (compute_control,    0.5, "control"),     # knee ~6.4 — moderate
])
# Done. No weights. Each k is chosen once based on physical meaning.
# Output always in [0, 1). Pass directly to Constran.build().
```

## 6. Guidelines for Choosing k

### Approach A: Physical Knee ("I know what value matters")

1. Decide: "at what raw value should this term be half-saturated?"
2. `k = knee_to_k(raw_knee)`

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import knee_to_k

k_lat = knee_to_k(0.3)   # "0.3m lateral error → knee"
k_lon = knee_to_k(10.0)  # "10m longitudinal error → knee"
```

### Approach B: Typical + Max ("I know the operating range")

1. Estimate typical and maximum raw values
2. `k = suggest_k(typical, max)`

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import suggest_k

k = suggest_k(typical=2.0, max=100.0)
```

### Approach C: Start from defaults, diagnose, iterate

1. Start with `k=1.0` for all terms
2. Run `inspect_terms()` on a few candidate solutions
3. If a term always shows `[saturated]` → reduce its k (widen range)
4. If a term always shows `[linear]` and contributes little → increase k

## 7. Adaptive k via Semantic Roles

When you **don't know** the magnitude of each term upfront, use
`compose_objective_adaptive`. Instead of specifying k, you assign each term
a **semantic role**, and k is auto-calibrated from the empirical distribution
of random samples.

### 7.1 The Idea

| You know | You don't know |
|----------|---------------|
| This is my *main* objective | Its typical raw value |
| This is a *secondary* preference | Its maximum |
| This is a *tiebreaker* | Its dynamic range |

The role maps to a **percentile** of the term's empirical distribution.
The knee is set at that percentile, and k is derived automatically.

| Role | Percentile | Knee at | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `'primary'` | P50 | Median | Wide linear range — worst half saturates |
| `'secondary'` | P70 | 70th pctile | Moderate — 70% in linear region |
| `'tiebreaker'` | P95 | 95th pctile | Mostly linear — only extremes saturate |

You can also pass a bare float: `0.40` = P40, `0.99` = P99.

### 7.2 Usage

```python
from Constraintdealer.ObjectiveComposer import compose_objective_adaptive

ctx_calib = {'target': jnp.array([8.0, 6.0]),
             'init_state': jnp.array([0., 0., 0., 0.])}

obj = compose_objective_adaptive([
    (tracking_fn,   'primary',    "tracking"),     # P50
    (final_fn,      'secondary',  "final"),        # P70
    (smooth_fn,     'tiebreaker', "smoothness"),   # P95
], n_dims=16, bounds=(-5.0, 5.0), n_samples=1000,
   ctx_calib=ctx_calib)
```

Output during calibration:
```
--- Adaptive K Calibration ---
  tracking            : P50  knee=4.2371  k=0.6645
  final               : P70  knee=0.8920  k=1.4752
  smoothness          : P95  knee=6.1804  k=0.5100
```

### 7.3 Sample Sources (choose based on cost)

| Source | Parameter | Extra cost | When |
|--------|----------|------------|------|
| Random uniform | `n_dims` + `bounds` | n_samples × term calls | Cold start, cheap terms |
| Warmup samples | `warmup_samples` | **Zero** | MPC: reuse solver's first-step samples |
| Custom generator | `sample_fn` | n_samples calls | Known decision space structure |

```python
# Zero-overhead: reuse solver samples from warmup
obj = compose_objective_adaptive([
    (track_fn, 'primary', "track"),
], warmup_samples=mu_k_samples, ctx_calib=ctx)

# Cheap: random uniform
obj = compose_objective_adaptive([
    (track_fn, 'primary', "track"),
], n_dims=16, bounds=(-3.0, 3.0), n_samples=500, ctx_calib=ctx)
```

### 7.4 Integration with build()

```python
from Constraintdealer.Constran import build, Deterministic

obj = compose_objective_adaptive([...], n_dims=16, ctx_calib=ctx)
cost_fn = build(obj, [Deterministic(obs_fn, mode='hard', priority=1)])
# cost_fn ready for solver
```

## 8. API Reference

### `compose_objective(terms, *, k_outer=1.0, jit_result=True)`

Main entry point. Each term is `(fn, k)` or `(fn, k, name)`.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `terms` | list of tuple | required | `(fn, k, name?)` per sub-objective |
| `k_outer` | float | 1.0 | Final compression knee |
| `jit_result` | bool | True | Wrap with `jax.jit` |

Returns `(x, ctx) -> scalar` in [0, 1).

### `compose_objective_auto(terms, *, k_outer=1.0, jit_result=True)`

Auto-suggest k from typical and max. Each term is `(fn, typical, max_or_None)`.

### `compose_objective_adaptive(terms, *, n_dims=..., bounds=..., ..., ctx_calib=..., k_outer=1.0)`

Auto-calibrate k from semantic roles. Each term is `(fn, role, name?)`.
Role: `'primary'` (P50), `'secondary'` (P70), `'tiebreaker'` (P95),
or a float percentile. Requires `ctx_calib` and a sample source.

### `knee_to_k(raw_knee) -> float`

Convert physical knee to k. `raw_knee = exp(1/k) - 1`.

### `k_to_knee(k) -> float`

Convert k to physical knee. Inverse of `knee_to_k`.

### `suggest_k(raw_typical, raw_max=None) -> float`

Heuristic k suggestion from typical and max values.

### `inspect_terms(composed_obj, x, ctx, terms_info) -> dict`

Per-term diagnostic: raw value, compressed value, saturation status.

## 9. When NOT to Use

- **Single-term objective**: `build_unconstrained()` is simpler
- **Already normalized**: if all terms are naturally in [0, 1], just sum them
- **Known, fixed weights**: if you've already tuned weights and they work, keep them
- **Gradient-based solvers**: the sigma nesting adds nonlinearity; check if your
  gradient method tolerates it (IGO is gradient-free, so no issue)

## 10. Demo

## 12. Connection to the Small Gain Theorem

The user has observed a deep structural parallel between our k-based gain control
and the **Small Gain Theorem** (小增益理论) from nonlinear control theory.
This section formalizes that connection.

### 11.1 Quick Review: The Small Gain Theorem

The classical Small Gain Theorem (Zames, 1966) states:

> Consider two causal systems $H_1$, $H_2$ with finite $\mathcal{L}_2$ gains
> $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$. If $\gamma_1 \cdot \gamma_2 < 1$, then the feedback
> interconnection of $H_1$ and $H_2$ is finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_2$ stable.

In simpler terms: **if each subsystem amplifies signals by at most $\gamma_i$,
and the product of amplifications is < 1, the whole system is stable.**

The Small Gain Theorem is a special case of a broader unification — the
**Circle Criterion** and **Passivity Theorem** all emerge from the same
semi-inner product space framework (see "Unified Necessary and Sufficient
Conditions for the Robust Stability of Interconnected Sector-Bounded
Systems", arXiv:1809.08742).

### 11.2 σ_k as a Sector-Bounded Nonlinearity

Our saturation function:

$$\sigma_k(x) = \frac{kx}{\sqrt{1 + (kx)^2}}$$

is a **memoryless, sector-bounded nonlinearity** — exactly the kind of
nonlinearity that the Circle Criterion and Small Gain Theorem were designed
to handle.

**Sector characterization.** For all $x \neq 0$:

$$0 < \frac{\sigma_k(x)}{x} \le k$$

That is, $\sigma_k$ lies in the **sector $[0, k]$** — it's bounded below by 0
(passivity) and above by k (gain limit).

**Lipschitz / incremental gain.** The derivative:

$$\sigma_k'(x) = \frac{k}{(1 + (kx)^2)^{3/2}} \le k$$

So $|\sigma_k(x) - \sigma_k(y)| \le k|x-y|$. **k IS the Lipschitz constant** —
the maximum amplification any input difference can experience.

**Saturation (absolute bound).** $|\sigma_k(x)| < 1$ for all $x$, regardless of k.
This is the "saturation" property — no matter how large the input, the output
is bounded. In control terms: $\sigma_k$ has **finite $\mathcal{L}_\infty$ gain
of 1**, regardless of its $\mathcal{L}_2$ gain k.

### 11.3 The k Parameter IS the Gain

In control theory, the "gain" $\gamma$ of a system is the worst-case ratio of
output energy to input energy:

$$\gamma = \sup_{u \neq 0} \frac{\|H(u)\|}{\|u\|}$$

For our $\sigma_k$, the incremental gain (Lipschitz constant) is exactly k.
This is why we call k the **gain** — it's not just a metaphor, it's a
mathematically precise statement:

| k | Lipschitz gain | Meaning |
|---|---------------|---------|
| 5.0 | 5.0 | High gain — small input changes amplified 5× |
| 1.0 | 1.0 | Unity gain — non-expansive |
| 0.5 | 0.5 | Low gain — a contraction, signal attenuated |
| 0.1 | 0.1 | Very low gain — strong attenuation |

### 11.4 The Nesting as a Gain-Bounded Interconnection

Our `compose_objective` structure:

$$f(x) = \sigma_{k_{\text{outer}}}\!\left(\sum_i \sigma_{k_i}\!\big(\mathcal{T}(\text{term}_i(x))\big)\right)$$

can be interpreted as a **feedforward interconnection of gain-bounded subsystems**:

```
term₁(x) → [T] → [σ_{k₁}] ↘
term₂(x) → [T] → [σ_{k₂}] → [ Σ ] → [σ_{k_outer}] → f(x)
term₃(x) → [T] → [σ_{k₃}] ↗
```

Each channel has:
- **Log-transform** $\mathcal{T}$: compresses dynamic range (like a logarithmic
  amplifier / compander in signal processing)
- **Saturation** $\sigma_{k_i}$: sector-bounded nonlinearity with gain $k_i$,
  output bounded in $(-1, 1)$

The **adder** $\Sigma$ has gain $\le \sum k_i$ in the worst case.

The **outer** $\sigma_{k_{\text{outer}}}$ provides **global gain bounding**:
regardless of how many terms there are or how large their sum, the output
is always in $(-1, 1)$.

### 11.5 Why This "Just Works" — A Small-Gain Argument

**Claim:** The composed objective cannot be dominated by any single term.

**Proof sketch (small-gain style):**

1. Each sub-term channel has **finite gain** $k_i$ (Lipschitz constant)
2. Each channel output is **absolutely bounded**: $|\sigma_{k_i}(\cdot)| < 1$
3. The sum of $N$ terms has gain $\le \sum k_i$, but output is bounded in
   $(-N, N)$
4. The outer $\sigma_{k_{\text{outer}}}$ compresses $(-N, N)$ back to $(-1, 1)$
   — it has **finite $\mathcal{L}_\infty$ gain** regardless of $N$
5. Therefore: **bounded input (raw term values) → bounded output (cost)** —
   an **Input-to-State Stability (ISS)** property

Unlike linear weights $w_i \cdot \text{term}_i$ where one large term can make
$f \to \infty$, the saturation nesting guarantees $f \in (-1, 1)$ always.
No single term can "destabilize" the overall cost.

### 11.6 The Outer σ as a "Loop Gain" Controller

In a feedback control system, you typically add a controller to reduce loop
gain below 1 for stability. In our feedforward structure:

$$\text{outer } \sigma \text{ acts like an automatic gain controller}$$

- If all inner terms are small → sum is small → outer σ operates in its
  linear region (gain ≈ k_outer) → good distinguishability
- If some inner terms are large → sum is large → outer σ saturates →
  total output bounded → prevents blow-up
- The transition is **continuous** (no hard clipping) → gradient is preserved

This is analogous to an **Automatic Gain Control (AGC)** circuit in
communications, or a **gain-scheduled controller** that adapts its
amplification based on signal magnitude.

### 11.7 Deeper Connections

**Contraction mapping.** For $k \le 1$, each $\sigma_k$ is a **contraction**
in the Banach sense:

$$|\sigma_k(x) - \sigma_k(y)| \le k|x-y| < |x-y|$$

The composition of contractions is a contraction. This connects to the
**Banach Fixed-Point Theorem** — iterated application converges to a unique
fixed point. In our context: small changes in raw term values cannot cause
disproportionately large changes in cost.

**Circle Criterion.** For a Lur'e system (linear dynamics + sector-bounded
nonlinearity in feedback), the Circle Criterion guarantees stability if the
Nyquist plot of the linear part avoids a disk determined by the sector bounds.
Our saturation $\sigma_k \in [0, k]$ is a canonical example — the sector
bounds tell us exactly how "aggressive" the nonlinearity is.

**Passivity.** $\sigma_k$ is **passive**: $\sigma_k(x) \cdot x \ge 0$ for all
$x$ (it's an odd function with $\sigma_k(x)/x > 0$). In interconnected passive
systems, stability follows from the Passivity Theorem — another unification
with the Small Gain Theorem.

**ISS (Input-to-State Stability).** The entire composition satisfies:

$$\|f\|_\infty \le 1 \quad \text{regardless of input magnitude}$$

This is the strongest form of ISS — the output is **globally uniformly
ultimately bounded** with bound 1. No tuning of k can change this guarantee.

### 11.8 Practical Implication: Choosing k via Gain Reasoning

The control-theoretic perspective gives a principled way to choose k:

| Control concept | Our equivalent | Implication for k |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Loop gain | k (Lipschitz constant) | k < 1: contraction, k > 1: amplification |
| Gain margin | How much k can increase before instability | Outer σ provides infinite gain margin |
| Sector bound | σ_k ∈ [0, k] | k defines the linear operating region |
| Saturation limit | |σ_k| < 1 | Always safe, independent of k |
| Bandwidth | 1/k (knee location) | Small k = wide bandwidth, large k = narrow |
| Gain scheduling | Different k per term | Each sub-objective has its own "channel gain" |

**The key insight:** You're not just picking a dimensionless weight — you're
**designing the gain of a nonlinear control channel** whose stability is
guaranteed by the saturation structure. The outer σ is the "safety net"
that bounds total gain regardless of how many terms you add or how large
their k values are.
